### My First Personal Website
---
This is a simple personal website frontend which is totally hand-written. Only the theme was referenced from [kratos](https://github.com/vtrois/kratos) developed by [vtrois](https://github.com/vtrois), and some design inspirations were derived from [iwomen's blog](https://www.iwowen.cn/).

#### How to Use
---
1. First clone this repository into your personal computer
&emsp;  `git clone https://github.com/tonyLyx1/personal-website.git`
2. Then, run `npm start` to start the React-App and you can see my website 
(I have already set the backend url and port to be mine, so dont' worry if you don't have your own. I also wrote some articles to share with you guys how everything should be done to develop your own personal website).
3. After you have finished your own backend, change `/src/api/backend.js` to your APIs and you can see your own version.
4. Finally, run `npm run build` to deploy the React-App.
